#Spring Annotations
--> Spring framework implements and promotes the principle of control inversion (IOC) or dependency injection (DI) and is in fact an IOC container.
--> Traditionally, Spring allows a developer to manage bean dependencies by using XML-based configuration.
--> There is an alternative way to define beans and their dependencies. This method is a Java-based configuration.
--> Unlike the XML approach, Java-based configuration allows you to manage bean components programmatically. Thatâ€™s why Spring annotations were introduced.
